# STM Hardware Drivers

By default STM provides a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) however in my experience this doesn't allow for qucik STM Startup.

The hardware libraries being developed in this project are meant to allow for simple, hardware startup, which hopefully will be indistinguishable from the hardware level itself.

# Hardware Levels

* GPIO
* PWM
* UART
* ADC
